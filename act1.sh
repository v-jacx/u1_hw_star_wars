# 1. In this directory, create a new directory called star_wars. Example answer: mkdir star_wars
mkdir star_wars
u1_hw_star_wars git:(main) mkdir star_wars
# 2. In the star_wars folder, create two new directories: empire and rebellion (This can be done in two commands, but how would you do it in one?)
star_wars git:(main) mkdir empire rebellion
# 3. Inside the empire directory, create a file called darth_vader.txt 
empire git:(main) touch darth_vader.txt
# 4. Use the force (or your echo) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the darth_vader.txt file (Don’t remember how to do this? Internet search it!)
empire git:(main) ✗ echo "...heavy breathing..." >> darth_vader.txt
# 5. Inside the empire directory, create a file called emperor_palpatine.txt
  empire git:(main) ✗ touch emperor_palpatine.txt
# 6. Inside the empire directory, create a directory called death_star
  empire git:(main) ✗ mkdir death_star
# 7. Move darth_vader.txt into the death_star
  empire git:(main) ✗ mv darth_vader.txt death_star
